# ⚡ Forecasting UK Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) Adoption to 2035  
*A Time-Series & Machine Learning Analysis for a Master's Dissertation*  

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the **code, datasets, and analytical workflow** for my MSc Business Analytics dissertation project.  
The study forecasts **Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) adoption in the United Kingdom** up to **2035**, combining **statistical time-series models** and **machine learning** within the **CRISP-DM framework**.

### 🔑 Key Findings
- ✅ **SARIMAX** model delivers the most statistically accurate **short-term forecasts**, outperforming Prophet, LightGBM, and baseline regression.  
- 📈 **Google Trends (public interest)** is the most significant **leading indicator** of BEV demand.  
- ⚡ Charging infrastructure and household income effects **diminish** as the market matures.  
- 🚦 UK is projected to **miss the 2030 Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate** of 80% BEV market share, achieving it in **late 2031** under optimistic scenarios.  

   *An accompanying interactive Dash dashboard translates these findings into decision-ready visuals for executives (interactive dashboard: https://ev-adoption-analysis-dashboard.onrender.com/)*.

## ⚙️ Methodology
The workflow follows a **structured five-phase pipeline**:

1. **Data Collection & Merging** 📊  
   Aggregated monthly BEV registrations + economic, infrastructure, and behavioral indicators.  

2. **Exploratory Analysis & Feature Engineering** 🔍  
   - Time-series decomposition, ADF tests, correlations.  
   - PCA, lag/rolling features to capture temporal dependencies.  

3. **Model Development & Comparison** 🤖  
   - Benchmarked **Linear Regression, SARIMAX, Prophet, LightGBM**.  
   - Out-of-sample evaluation → **SARIMAX champion model**.  

4. **Research Question Analysis** 📑  
   - **Interrupted Time Series (ITS)**, **Granger Causality**, and **LOESS smoothing**.  

5. **Hybrid Forecasting & Scenario Analysis** 🔮  
   - **Short-Term (2024–2027):** SARIMAX baseline + economic stress.  
   - **Long-Term (to 2035):** Logistic Growth (S-curve) with four strategic adoption paths.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/AshishSiwach/Masters_Dissertation.git](https://github.com/AshishSiwach/Masters_Dissertation.git)
cd Masters_Dissertation

2. Set up a Python environment:
It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pmdarima prophet lightgbm scikit-learn jupyter
